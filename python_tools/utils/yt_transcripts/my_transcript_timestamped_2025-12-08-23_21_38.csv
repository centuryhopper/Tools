Do not die.,0:01
Hi friends. Given that we are the first,0:04
"generation who won't die, my team and I",0:06
have scoured the scientific literature,0:09
looking for the evidence on how to build,0:11
the best nutrition protocol. The rule is,0:13
every calorie has to fight for its life.,0:16
"Round one, fight. Every day I consume",0:20
"three meals and the meals vary daytoday,",0:24
but what they do have in common is a set,0:27
of foods that we have deemed to be the,0:30
superfoods of all things that I could,0:33
"put into my body. Today, I'm going to",0:35
share with you how my personal chef,0:36
prepares three of these dishes. While,0:38
0:40,5 Rules For Every Blueprint Meal
0:43,"the recipes change, each meal must meet"
0:45,the following criteria. They have to be
0:47,the most elite ingredients for
0:49,longevity. It needs to keep me within my
0:53,"daily macros of 25% protein, 35%"
0:56,"carbohydrates, and 40% fat. The"
0:57,ingredients need to be included in the
0:59,"don't diet food guide. And obviously, it"
1:01,can't include the bad things such as
1:03,"sugars, fried foods, etc. You would be"
1:05,"surprised, and maybe you're not, of how"
1:07,frequently you find these things hiding
1:09,in your food. My chef also prepares the
1:10,food in a way where we can make it one
Sweet Potato Curry,day and have enough food for 3 days. All
"right, let's get started with sweet",1:14
potato curry. This dish meets the,1:15
criteria of foods from the Don't Die,1:18
"Food Guide, including macadamia nuts,",1:20
"cauliflower, turmeric. It's also great",1:21
because you can make it in under 30,1:24
"minutes. First, chop one whole onion.",1:25
"There's no correct way of doing this,",1:28
"but I aim for a fine dice. Once done,",1:30
take a medium stainless steel pot and,1:32
put it on mediumigh heat. It's crucial,1:35
that your pots are stainless steel or,1:37
"ceramic, as non-stick cookware releases",1:40
forever chemicals known as PAS into your,1:42
food. These can stick around for,1:46
"decades, messing with your metabolism,",1:47
"hormones, and fertility.",1:50
"Once your pot is heated up, add in half",1:52
a tablespoon of avocado oil. Use avocado,1:55
oil when cooking because it has a higher,1:58
smoke point. This will form fewer toxic,2:00
carcinogens than other oils during,2:02
cooking. Keep it on medium heat to make,2:05
sure the oil does not exceed 375°,2:07
F or 190° C.,2:10
"Once the oil starts to simmer, add in",2:14
your onion. Stir and carry on cooking,2:16
until it's nice and translucent. It's,2:18
going to be about 5 minutes.,2:21
"As the onion cooks, use a spoon to peel",2:24
your ginger. This is faster than using a,2:26
knife or peeler and way more efficient,2:29
because you don't remove any of the,2:31
juicy flesh underneath.,2:33
"Next, peel a couple of cloves of garlic",2:36
and chop them with the ginger into a,2:38
fine mince.,2:40
Let it cook with your onion for a few,2:43
minutes. There should be an amazing,2:45
smell in your kitchen right now.,2:47
"While the aromatics are cooking, peel",2:50
your sweet potatoes and chop into cubes.,2:52
Sweet potatoes have more fiber than,2:55
"regular potatoes, so you absorb their",2:57
natural sugars slower. This reduces,2:59
blood sugar spikes and keeps you feeling,3:02
fuller for longer. Add to your pot.,3:04
"Then, peel and chop your carrots into",3:07
rounds.,3:09
Add them to the pot as well. Giving,3:12
"everything a nice stir. Okay, more",3:14
vegetables. Time to chop your broccoli,3:17
and cauliflower. There are two things to,3:20
"keep in mind here. First, use the stock",3:22
and the fuates because the stock adds a,3:24
"nice earthy taste and has more iron,",3:27
"calcium, vitamin C, and fiber. Second,",3:30
"and this is an odd one, for the best",3:33
"health results, let the broccoli and",3:35
cauliflower sit for 40 minutes after,3:36
chopping before you cook it. This is,3:39
because chopping activates a natural,3:41
enzyme in broccoli and cauliflower,3:43
"called mirrosynise, which then unlocks",3:45
"sulfurophane, one of the strongest",3:48
anti-cancer compounds you can find in,3:50
food. It also has potential,3:52
sugar-lowering detoxifying properties.,3:54
But heat from cooking stops this,3:57
process. So chop at the start of your,3:59
cooking session and wait a bit to let,4:01
your vegetable reach maximum,4:04
sulfurophane levels. So we have all our,4:05
"aromatics in the pot, including ginger,",4:08
"garlic, and onion, which are the base of",4:11
every good curry.,4:13
Now we'll add in the black pepper and a,4:16
teaspoon of turmeric. We're adding black,4:18
pepper because it boosts the power of,4:20
the turmeric.,4:22
A compound in pepper called piperin,4:24
slows the breakdown of curcumin in your,4:27
gut and liver.,4:29
This makes it more stable inside your,4:31
"body and makes its antioxidant,",4:33
"anti-inflammatory, and metabolic",4:35
benefits last longer.,4:37
Give everything a good stir to,4:40
incorporate all the flavors.,4:42
"Next, add in your broccoli, rested or",4:45
"unrested, and cauliflower, and pour in",4:48
"enough water to cover everything, giving",4:50
it a nice stir.,4:53
Now bring up to a boil and then cover,4:55
the pot and let it gently simmer for 15,4:57
"minutes. While that's coming to a boil,",4:59
we'll make our quinoa. Heat up a,5:02
mediumsized pot. Add in two cups of,5:04
vegetable stock and 1 cup of quinoa.,5:06
"Once that comes up to a boil, lower the",5:12
heat and simmer for 15 minutes.,5:14
Now juice two limes and reserve the,5:18
juice until you finish cooking. You,5:20
always want to add lemon or lime juice,5:22
at the end of your stews or curries,5:24
"because if you do it too early, it loses",5:26
the citrus flavors you want in your,5:28
dish.,5:30
"Now, we're going to chop our trimmed",5:31
green beans into bite-sized pieces.,5:33
Place to the side and chop your,5:36
cilantro.,5:37
[Music],5:39
Now that the quinoa is finished cooking,5:41
"after 15 minutes, turn off the heat and",5:43
"let it sit aside covered. Next, we'll",5:45
add in the rest of our ingredients to,5:48
"the curry. peas,",5:49
"green beans,",5:53
"cilantro,",5:56
citrus juice.,5:58
"Finally, macadamia nutmilk will give",6:01
your curry a really nice creamy flavor,6:04
and color. Macadamia is rich in,6:06
monounsaturated fats and can lower blood,6:08
sugar and bad cholesterol.,6:11
Bring that up to a quick boil and then,6:15
turn off the heat and set aside. Now,6:17
it's time for plating. I think the,6:20
plating is just as important as the,6:21
"cooking. Precise, intentional",6:23
arrangements stimulate the appetite and,6:26
encourage you to eat slower and more,6:28
"mindfully, which all improves digestion",6:30
"and nutrition absorption. To plate, give",6:32
the quinoa a nice little fluff with your,6:35
fork. Add to the plate as a base. Top,6:37
with the curry and add plenty of curry,6:40
broth because that's where all the,6:43
flavor is. Garnish with black sesame,6:44
"seeds, cilantro, and micro greens. And",6:47
"if you're feeling extra bougie, you can",6:50
add in some edible flowers. Finish with,6:52
a wedge of lime and enjoy. Bona petit.,6:54
"If you're meal prepping, keep the curry",6:58
and quinoa in separate containers. Then,7:00
reheat and combine when you're ready to,7:02
eat.,7:04
7:05,Green Smoothie
7:08,Next up is the green smoothie. I love
7:10,this dish because it's like a summertime
7:11,palette cleanser.
7:13,It's loaded with healthy ingredients and
7:15,tastes absolutely delicious. You might
7:17,have heard that you shouldn't consume
7:18,fruit in juice form because it strips
7:20,away all the fiber and lets your body
7:23,absorb sugar unnaturally fast. This is
7:25,"all true, but it doesn't apply to"
7:27,smoothies. The key difference is that
7:29,"for smoothies, you don't remove the"
7:30,solid parts of the fruits and
7:32,vegetables. You just blend them all
7:34,together. This means you still get their
7:36,"natural fiber content, which regulates"
7:39,"sugar absorption, feeds your gut"
7:41,"microbiota, and prevents inflammation."
7:43,"In fact, adding vegetables, nuts, and"
7:46,fats to your smoothie dilutes the sugar
7:47,"content of the fruit, slowing down"
7:49,absorption even more and keeping you
7:52,"full for longer. All right, let's get"
7:55,"going. First, add in your macadamia nut."
7:56,Adding the liquid first stops your
7:58,ingredients from stalling the blender.
8:01,"Next, add in one banana, frozen if"
8:03,"possible, to thicken the consistency of"
8:05,the smoothie. Then add in the rest of
8:09,"your ingredients. Mac nuts, three frozen"
8:10,"cherries,"
8:13,"pomegranate seeds,"
8:15,"hemp seeds,"
8:17,"wheat grass,"
8:19,"vanilla extract,"
8:21,"chia seeds,"
8:25,"juice of half of a lemon, and one celery"
8:28,stock. These were all chosen for a
8:30,reason. Pomegranates have unique
8:31,polyphenols that protects your
8:34,"cholesterol from oxidation, which all"
8:36,improves your blood flow. Dark cherries
8:37,have another distinct type of elite
8:39,polyphenols that help with
8:41,cardiovascular health and are rich in
8:43,"melatonin, which helps with sleep. Hemp"
8:45,seeds are a great source of essential
8:48,omega-3 and omega6 fat with a remarkable
8:51,32% protein content. Close the lid and
8:53,give everything a good blend for 30
8:55,seconds.
8:58,"Next, add in a handful or two of washed"
9:00,spinach and blend again until all your
9:03,ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Take
9:05,your glass and serve your smoothie. Note
9:07,that this will be a thicker smoothie. If
9:09,"you want to make it less thick, you can"
9:11,always add in more filtered water or
9:13,your choice of nutmilk. Top off with a
9:15,little strawberry and mint and you're
9:17,ready to go. This is a great meal prep
9:19,smoothie. You can make a big batch and
9:20,store in the fridge in an airtight
9:23,container for up to 3 to 4 days. Just
9:25,make sure to give it a quick stir or
"Roasted Veg, Lentil & Chickpea Bowl",shake before enjoying.
"Finally, we have the roasted vegetable,",9:26
"chickpea, and lentil bowl. I love this",9:28
dish because I have learned to,9:31
absolutely love vegetables and legumes.,9:32
Roasting makes the vegetables sweet and,9:36
juicy. The lentils are packed with,9:39
"protein, and the creamy chickpea",9:40
dressing has a great hit of high,9:42
polyphenol olive oil. Of our three,9:44
"recipes, this might be the most",9:46
satisfying to eat.,9:48
Preheat your oven to 400° and start,9:50
chopping the vegetables. We'll start,9:53
with half of a cauliflower and cut into,9:54
bite-sized pieces. Keep the other half,9:56
"in your fridge for later, or you can",9:58
double the recipe to make more portions.,10:00
Set this aside in a mixing bowl and chop,10:02
up one zucchini.,10:04
"Now, take your red bell pepper, cut the",10:09
top and bottom like this. Cut in the,10:11
middle and slice out the bitter white,10:14
membrane before chopping into bite-sized,10:16
pieces.,10:18
"Once you're done chopping vegetables,",10:21
measure about 1 teaspoon of macadamia,10:23
nut oil or any kind of oil with a high,10:25
smoke point like avocado. Take a tiny,10:28
bit of this oil and spread onto your,10:30
baking sheet to prevent sticking when,10:32
the vegetables are in the oven. Then add,10:33
the rest of your oil to your bowl of,10:35
mixed vegetables. Give everything a good,10:37
toss and add to your baking sheet.,10:39
Spread evenly and place in the oven at,10:41
400° for about 15 minutes. Now that the,10:43
"vegetables are in the oven, we'll start",10:46
cooking our black lentils. Lentils are,10:48
"18% protein, but also 16% fiber, which",10:50
"again slows down food absorption, making",10:54
you fuller for longer and reducing blood,10:56
sugar spikes.,10:58
Studies suggest that eating 10 g of,11:00
legume fibers every day lowers colon,11:02
cancer risk by 32% versus just 10% for,11:05
the same amount of other dietary fibers.,11:08
Add about 1 and 1/2 cups of cold water,11:11
and 3/4 of a cup of black lentils.,11:15
"Bring up to a boil, then partially cover",11:21
with a pot lid and turn down to a medium,11:23
low temp. We're going to let this simmer,11:26
for about 15 minutes.,11:27
"Next, we're going to sauté our shiakei",11:31
mushrooms. We're using shiakei because,11:33
they have three particularly healthy,11:35
"compounds. Aergoionine, lentinine, and",11:37
aerotadin.,11:40
Bring your stainless steel pan up to a,11:42
really high heat for a few minutes so,11:44
that the pan becomes non-stick. I like,11:46
to take a teaspoon of water and splash,11:48
it onto the heated stainless steel pan.,11:50
"If the water forms beads, that means",11:51
that your pan is officially non-stick,11:53
and ready for cooking.,11:55
Place the shiakei mushrooms in the,11:58
preheated pan with a teaspoon of avocado,12:00
oil or any type of high smoke point oil.,12:02
"Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring",12:04
occasionally.,12:06
"Once cooked, take your mushrooms off the",12:10
"heat and set aside. Now, let's make our",12:12
dressing. Take a cup of cooked,12:14
"chickpeas,",12:16
"1 tbsp of nutritional yeast,",12:18
"1 tbsp of olive oil,",12:21
"one garlic clove,",12:24
"a tablespoon of lemon juice,",12:27
"4 tbsp of filtered water, and a handful",12:30
of chives.,12:33
Put everything in the blender and blend,12:35
for 30 seconds. High polyphenol olive,12:37
oil is the most powerful ingredient in,12:39
this dressing. It increases HDL or good,12:42
cholesterol and reduces several key,12:44
markers of cardiovascular disease. We,12:47
use blueprint olive oil as it has a very,12:49
high polyphenol count. Garlic has also,12:51
been shown to lower blood pressure and,12:54
help the immune system.,12:56
Once your lentils and vegetables have,12:59
"been cooked, take everything off the",13:01
heat and set to cool.,13:03
Plate up by placing your lentils in a,13:06
"shallow bowl. Next, take your roasted",13:08
"vegetables, sauteed mushrooms, and a",13:10
handful or two of kale. Add our dressing,13:12
to the mixing bowl and give everything a,13:15
nice toss. Put a big helping of,13:17
vegetable mix on your lentils. Add in a,13:19
large pinch of hemp seeds and a wedge of,13:21
lemon. And that's it. You now have an,13:23
easy and nutritious meal that you can,13:25
make in less than 30 minutes. Enjoy.,13:27
