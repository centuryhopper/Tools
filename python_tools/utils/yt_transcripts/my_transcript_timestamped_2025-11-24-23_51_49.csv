Miami Beach talking about some of the,0:08
best places to eat in Miami Beach in,0:10
2025. If you're headed over to this area,0:12
and you're actually wondering where the,0:14
"locals like to eat, or you're just",0:16
craving something amazing that's beyond,0:18
the tourist traps that you typically see,0:19
"everywhere, then this is the video for",0:21
you. I'm giving you the ultimate 2025,0:23
Miami Beach food guide packed with must-,0:26
"vvisit restaurants, hidden gems, as well",0:28
as some unique bites that you want to,0:30
try. I also have the price ranges,0:32
included just so you know what to expect,0:34
when you're visiting these locations.,0:36
"So, let's eat our way through South",0:38
Beach and Mid Beach. Let's dive on,0:40
"in. So, Bacon is brunch with an",0:43
0:46,Bacon Bitch – Brunch with bold flavors & attitude
0:49,attitude. Hopefully YouTube doesn't flag
0:50,that just because the restaurant itself
0:53,"is very well-known, very popular, and"
0:57,"has a unique vibe to it. It is a bold,"
1:00,"cheeky, and super likable place. Uh,"
1:03,"very Instagrammable, and it's not just"
1:05,in the name. The food here is actually
1:09,"genuinely good. Expect high energy, a"
1:12,"fun staff, and a loud brunch scene with"
1:14,the staff members playing into the
1:16,actual name of the establishment. Some
1:18,of the must try things here is going to
1:20,be the OG This is a sandwich that
1:24,usually goes for $14 to $18. The Bougie
1:26,"which is smoked salmon, avocado,"
1:29,and cream cheese on a croissant. Or one
1:31,"of the mimosa flights, or a bacon bloody"
1:34,"mary. Yes, I said bacon. And that could"
1:37,"run you about $12 to $15 per drink. So,"
1:39,when you're over at Bacon I want
1:42,you to expect to spend about $ 20 to $30
1:44,"per person, including drinks. And this"
1:47,is obviously over in the South Beach
1:48,"area. Next, let's talk about a"
Naked Taco – Flavor-packed Mexican eats,restaurant that also has a unique name
"to it. Let's talk about Naked Taco. Yes,",1:50
I said that right. Naked Taco brings,1:53
edgy Mexican cuisine right to Collins,1:56
Avenue in South Beach. The interior,1:58
"there is fun and vibrant, and the patio",2:01
"is perfect for people watching, as well",2:03
as having a frozen margarita. Some of,2:05
the must try things from this restaurant,2:08
is going to be the duck tacos or the,2:10
bang bang shrimp tacos. And these can,2:12
usually run for about $5 to $7 per,2:14
taco. I also want you to give the,2:17
Mexican street corn a try which is just,2:19
about,2:22
$6. And also you must try one of the,2:22
jalapeno margaritas or go for the full,2:26
margarita flight. This is going to run,2:29
you $12 to $18.,2:31
"While you're at Naked Taco, I want you",2:33
guys to expect to spend about$25 to $40,2:35
"per person. And once again, this is over",2:37
on Collins Avenue right in South,2:40
Beach. You guys can't visit Miami,2:43
without getting a taste of good,2:45
2:47,Versailles Express – Iconic Cuban coffee & pastries
2:50,authentic Cuban coffee. The Versailles
2:52,Express makes that super easy for you.
2:54,This is something I look forward to
2:56,every time I'm in the South Florida area
2:58,and I'm looking to always look for a
3:01,spot that I can grab a strong colada or
3:03,a sweet cafe k leche as well as pair
3:07,that with a flaky guava and cheese
3:09,"pastel. While you're there, I want you"
3:12,to expect to spend $5 to $10. This is a
3:15,small cafe outpost in South Beach. Or if
3:17,"you're in town, you can go to the main"
3:18,"location, Little Havana, if you're still"
3:20,exploring.
3:23,"As I mentioned in my last video, Espanol"
3:25,Way is one of the most charming streets
Española Way – Foodie paradise with eclectic options,and spots in all of South Beach. There's
"cobblestone, string lights, live music,",3:27
"as well as endless dinner options. So,",3:30
"while you're there, I have two specific",3:33
spots that I want you to check out. I,3:35
want you to check out first,3:37
tapasintos. This is authentic Spanish,3:40
tapas like garlic shrimp and crocettas.,3:43
"And while you're there, you can expect",3:47
to spend about $8 to $14 per dish.,3:48
"Additionally, they have sangria pictures",3:52
"for about $30, which are perfect for",3:54
sharing. Next on this list is going to,3:57
be Italian. I want you to look at,3:59
Marcato de la Peseria. And while you're,4:02
"there, I want you to check out the",4:05
lobster ravioli or the truffle risoto.,4:06
And some of the entre there usually run,4:09
from about $22 to $38 depending on what,4:11
you get. And if you add different wine,4:14
"and appetizers, you're in for a decadent",4:17
night. While you're at these,4:19
"restaurants, you can expect to spend",4:21
"about $35 to $60 per person at Marcato,",4:23
"or a little bit cheaper, about $25 to",4:27
$45 per person at,4:30
Tapasintos. Both of these are right over,4:32
in South Beach at,4:34
"Espanol. So, one of the hidden gems that",4:37
I have over by Collins Park is going to,4:40
be Sweet Liberty.,4:42
4:44,"Sweet Liberty – Cocktails, comfort food, and local vibes"
4:46,Sweet Liberty. I want you to think
4:49,cocktails and comfort food. And it has a
4:51,casual retro vibe with award-winning
4:54,cocktails that are rich and comforting.
4:55,Some of the recommendations I do have
4:57,for this spot is going to be the lobster
5:00,"mac and cheese, which goes for about"
5:02,"$18, or the fried chicken and waffles,"
5:05,"which you can get for about $16, or"
5:06,enjoy one of the cocktails that they
5:08,"have on their menu, such as the"
5:10,"blackberry bourbon lemonade, which will"
5:13,"usually run you about $12 to $14. So,"
5:14,"while you're there, I want you to expect"
5:18,to spend about $30 to $45 per person.
5:21,And this is right over in Collins Park.
La Sandwicherie – Legendary late-night sandwiches,"Six on our list, let's talk about La"
"Saneri. Pretty sure I messed that up,",5:23
but that's all right. This is one of the,5:25
late night legends that's been around,5:27
since the8s. This iconic spot has a,5:29
"sandwich walkup counter, and it's",5:32
beloved for its fresh baguette,5:34
"sandwiches that's packed with meats,",5:36
"cheese, and that famous vinegarette.",5:38
Some of the best orders that I recommend,5:41
from that spot is going to be the,5:42
tropical or the pzudo mozzarella,5:45
"sandwich, which will be about $11 to",5:47
$15. And if you're looking to add a,5:49
smoothie or a fresh juice while headed,5:52
"over to the beach, you can add one of",5:54
"those on for about $5 to $7 more. So,",5:56
"while you're at this spot, you can",5:59
expect to spend about $12 to $18 per,6:01
person. And there's multiple locations,6:04
all over South Beach and all over Mid,6:06
Beach. and they're open late until 5 in,6:08
"the morning. All right, let's talk about",6:11
something that's beachy and clean,6:13
eating. Let's talk about Pure Vita. This,6:15
6:18,Pura Vida – Healthy eats with a beachside vibe
6:21,"is affordable, healthy, and tasty. And"
6:23,Pure Vita is the perfect spot if you're
6:25,"craving something that is light, but"
6:28,also filling at the same time. Some of
6:30,the top picks I have for this place is
6:32,"the chicken pesto bowl, which goes for"
6:36,about $15 to $18. the steak wrap with
6:38,chipotle ioli which runs for about $13
6:40,to $16 or one of the smoothies or
6:43,protein shakes that runs you about $8 to
6:45,"$11. While you're over here, you can"
6:48,expect to spend about $15 to $25 per
6:51,"person. And like I mentioned, this also"
6:53,"is over in Mid Beach, but also has"
6:56,several locations across Miami. We can't
6:58,talk about Miami without briefly
Ocean Drive Picks – Meals with a view of South Beach,"mentioning Ocean Drive. So, if you're"
going to splurge a little bit for the,7:00
"view, the Front Porch Cafe and the Local",7:01
"House are the right way to do it. So,",7:04
Front Porch Cafe is a breakfast and,7:07
brunch spot. And I want you to think,7:09
"blueberry pancakes, avocado toast with",7:12
"smoked salmon, and things of that",7:14
"nature, which could be a little bit more",7:16
"expensive for breakfast for some, and",7:19
that could be about $14 to,7:21
$22. And if you're looking to spend a,7:23
"little bit more than that, you could",7:26
talk about more of an upscale spot.,7:27
That's going to be the local house where,7:29
"they have different seared scallops,",7:32
truffle ops or mac as well as boutique,7:34
wines. These restaurants you can expect,7:36
to spend about $ 20 to $30 per person at,7:38
Front Porch. And then about $40 to $60,7:42
per person at the local house. And this,7:45
is right on Ocean Drive south of Fifth.,7:48
"Last but not least, let's talk about",7:51
"some of the food trucks. So, every",7:53
7:55,Food Truck Fridays – North Beach Bandshell street eats
7:58,"Friday night, the North Beach Band Shell"
8:00,hosts rotating food trucks with Cuban
8:03,"sandwiches, arapas, empanadas, tacos,"
8:06,and more. And there's always live music
8:08,"and a super chill, relaxed, fun"
8:10,"atmosphere. And while you're over here,"
8:12,"for these food trucks, you can expect to"
8:15,spend about 12 to $20 per person for
8:17,multiple items. And this is right over
8:19,in North Beach. This is a
8:21,family-friendly environment and also has
8:23,live free music that you can
8:26,"enjoy. So, moving on, I got three quick"
"Bonus Dessert Tips – Ice cream, pastries & sweet treats","dessert pro tips. So, Azakar Ice Cream"
"Company, I want you to go there and try",8:30
"the Abua Maria. This is guava, cream",8:32
"cheese, and Maria cookies or the cavone",8:35
leche. This is a unique spot where you,8:38
can pay about $5 to $7 per scoop. Next,8:41
on this list is going to be the Rosetta,8:44
Bakery. And I want you to head over,8:46
there and try the flaky pistachio,8:49
croissants. They're incredible and they,8:51
only cost about $4 to $8 per pastry. And,8:53
last on this list is going to be the,8:56
Freeze Ice Cream Factory. They have,8:58
small batch favorites like a simple,9:00
mango sorbet or rum raisin. And this ice,9:03
cream factory runs for about $5 to $6,9:06
per scoop. So there you have it. There's,9:08
9:12,Final Thoughts
9:14,nine incredible places to eat in Miami
9:17,Beach in 2025. from bold brunches and
9:19,tacos to romantic street cafes as well
9:22,as some late night bites and desserts.
9:24,Prices range from affordable eats to
9:26,"splurgeworthy views. So, there's"
9:27,something here no matter what your
9:29,"budget or vibe calls for. So, if this"
9:30,"helps you out, I want you guys to give"
