Yeah, the whole country. And I really strongly agree. This is a great airport and it's kind of a big point of local pride around here. We love this airport around here. It's just about 15 to 20 minutes or so, give or take, depending on traffic from downtown. And it's shockingly efficient. like you're off the plane, you've grabbed your luggage, and you're in your Uber in under 20 minutes, efficient. And if you think I'm exaggerating, I'm really not. This is easily one of the best designed airports in the world. And it's really, really easy to navigate quickly and find your way around. And if you're here, don't forget to say hi to Phoebe the Flamingo while you're here. This incredible sculpture right here in the main concourse has quickly become a local icon, and it's great for your Instagram, too. Once here, your main options from the airport are going to be renting a car, probably the best way to explore the area. This isn't really a great city for public transport, if I'm being honest, a ride share or taxi, or a hotel shuttle if you're staying nearby. And if you're heading into town for a cruise, Port Tampa Bay is right next to downtown. So, you're just steps away from all the action with lots of places to stay and things to do right there. 1:42 1:44 1:46 1:48 1:50 1:52 1:55 1:56 1:59 2:01 2:04 2:06 2:09 2:11 2:13 2:15 2:17 2:19 2:22 2:23 2:25 2:27 2:28 2:30 2:32 2:34 2:36 2:39 2:41 2:43 2:45 2:46 2:49 2:50 2:53 2:55 2:56 Where to Stay So, let's talk about where you might want to stay. This city is made up of a bunch of different neighborhoods, each with its own vibe, personality, and proximity to the stuff you'll actually want to do. Downtown is relatively walkable, and it's near museums, the Riverwalk, Amaly Arena, Sparkman Wararf, and the Cruise Port. It is a pretty safe downtown for the most part, but you know, just use common sense like you would anywhere else. And of course, your idea of walkable might be a lot different than other people's in the middle of the summer when it's really, really hot out here. Downtown is going to be best for firsttime visitors, cruisers, people who are going to events or conventions, or anybody without a car. And some hotels you might want to check out are going to be the Hyatt Place downtown, the Hotel Tampa Riverwalk, which is right along the river there, and the Water Street Marriott. This is a really big hotel right on the water downtown that's really popular for big events like Gasparilla. That's Tampa's biggest event of the year. It's kind of like Martyra meets Pirates. Happens every January. Hundreds of boats and thousands of pirates invade the bay and it's followed by one of the biggest parades in the entire country right down Beayshore Boulevard. Then a few weeks later, we do it all over again. This time at night in Eore City. This thing is a Tampa institution. Eore City is artsy. It's historic and it's alive with nightife. I would describe 7th Avenue here as kind of like Tampa's version of Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Lots of bars and clubs lining the road here. This is an area that was first settled by Cuban immigrants with old cigar factories, cool old brick buildings, and even a tiny little park that's still owned by the Cuban government today, and it is considered Cuban soil. So, when you step in here, you are technically technically in Cuba. And there are wild chickens running around Eore all over the place. They're basically like our little beloved local mascots, but Eore does have kind of a mixed reputation. There's a lot of bars and clubs here and depending on what kind of person you are and what kind of vibe you're after, you may either love it here or hate it here. But it is a really different scene during the day. So come out and check it out during the day if you're curious but don't want to deal with the party scene. This area is best for history buffs, night owls, and anyone looking for a little bit of character. You might want to check out the Hotel Ha. It's a stylish boutique hotel right here on 7th Avenue. But heads up, Eore can be loud at night, especially on weekends. So keep that in mind when booking. West Shore is the neighborhood near the airport with a lot of shopping malls, chain hotels, chain restaurants. Easy access to everything, though. It's not super scenic, but it is really convenient. And if you're planning a beach day, this area is pretty close to the bridges. They're going to take you over the bay into Penllis County. This area is probably going to be best for business travelers, those with early flights. They want quick access to the airport or quick overnight trips. And South Tampa is a leafy upscale residential area with historic neighborhoods like Hide Park and Beayshore. It's where you'll find boutique shops, historic homes, expensive homes, some big mansions along the water right here, and one of the longest continuous sidewalks in the world, Beayshore Boulevard. Now, Tampa likes to claim it's the longest sidewalk in the world at 4 and 1/2 miles, and you will see that a lot of places, but I have read that there's a longer one over in Galveastston, Texas that's like 10 mi long. So, this one might be up for debate, but it is great for joggers, dog walkers, and anyone who enjoys a scenic waterfront view of downtown. This is an area worth looking at if you want a more local, laid-back vibe with quick access to downtown. Check out the Epicurian Hotel. It's a boutique hotel right across from Burn Steakhouse. We're going to talk about them next. And the Sailport Waterfront Suites. But no matter where you're going to stay, book early. If you're coming for a big event like Gas Barilla, a big concert, or a convention, the good spots do go fast. 6:47 6:49 6:51 6:54 6:55 6:57 7:00 7:02 7:04 7:06 7:09 7:12 7:14 7:16 7:18 7:20 7:22 7:24 7:25 7:27 7:29 7:32 7:34 7:36 7:40 7:42 7:45 7:47 7:49 7:51 7:53 7:56 7:58 8:00 8:02 8:04 8:06 8:08 8:10 8:12 8:14 8:16 8:18 8:19 8:21 8:23 8:25 8:28 8:30 8:32 8:34 8:37 8:38 8:41 8:42 8:44 8:47 8:49 8:52 8:54 8:56 8:58 9:00 9:03 9:05 9:08 9:09 9:11 9:13 9:15 9:18 9:20 9:22 9:24 9:26 9:28 9:30 9:33 9:35 9:37 9:39 9:41 9:44 9:46 9:48 9:51 9:52 9:54 9:56 9:58 10:00 10:03 10:04 10:06 10:07 10:10 10:12 10:14 10:16 10:17 10:20 10:21 10:24 10:26 10:28 10:30 10:32 10:34 10:36 10:37 10:40 10:42 10:44 10:45 10:47 10:49 10:52 10:54 10:56 10:58 11:01 11:03 11:05 11:07 11:09 11:12 11:14 11:16 11:18 11:20 11:22 11:24 11:26 11:29 11:31 11:33 11:34 11:36 11:37 11:39 11:40 11:42 11:44 11:46 11:48 11:50 11:53 11:55 11:58 12:00 12:02 12:04 12:06 12:08 12:10 12:12 What to Do So, what are some of the best things to do around here? Number one, let's get this one out of the way first. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. I'm sure you've heard about this place. Part theme park, part zoo, this place has worldclass roller coasters like Iron Guazi, which is currently one of the tallest and fastest hybrid roller coasters in the whole world. That thing is super intense. Plus, they've got lions, giraffes, hyenas, and actual Serengeti style safaris. This is one of the biggest theme parks in the entire world, but check the weather before you plan a day here. This park, in your experience, can really be negatively impacted by a full day of bad weather since almost all of the attractions are outdoors. Yeah, you're probably going to get that passing thunderstorm that happens in Florida, that's not what I'm talking about. But if you look at the weather and see a lot of rain all day, you might want to schedule a different day to be here. But if you're a thrillseker, this is arguably the best theme park in Florida. Worldclass roller coaster collection here. The Florida Aquarium is located just on the edge of downtown near Sparkman Wararf. This is actually one of the top rated aquariums in the whole country. I love this place. Used to be a season pass member here for years. They've got sharks, stingrays, sea turtles. It's indoors. It's airond conditioned. That's important. And educational. You can go dolphin watching. You can explore a World War II era ship, the USS American Victory. Both of those do have an extra cost, by the way. And if you're here for a cruise and looking to kill a few hours before you set sail, this is a great choice since it's literally right next to the cruise port. The Tampa Riverwalk. So, this is about 2 and a half miles along the Hillsboro River. And this riverwalk links up museums, parks, restaurants, bars, lots of local attractions. You can rent a scooter, you can rent a bike, you can go for a jog, or just take a stroll. It's a great place to people watch, hang out, watch the boats cruise by. You might even spot a dolphin or a manatee in the river. right here. And this has been ranked as one of the best riverw walks in the country. And I did a video where I explore the entire riverwalk. And I'll link to that in the description. You get to see all the sites. Along the way here, you'll pass by Curtis Hixon Park. It's a big green space. It's perfect for families, music festivals, or just laying in the grass and staring at downtown. Right next to that is the Glazer Children's Museum, a top pick if you've got kids with you. And the Tampa Museum of Art is right here, which has a pretty nice collection of modern and classical art and some wild architecture. This building looks really cool at night. Eventually, this is going to take you to Amaly Arena. This is the home of the Tampa Bay Lightning, and it's a major concert venue, so there's always something happening right here. And I really recommend catching a Tampa Bay Lightning game if you're in town during hockey season. This is a great venue, and the Lightning games are a great experience. And it doesn't hurt. They always seem to have a good team out there, too. Eore City. Now, this is a neighborhood that was founded in the 1880s by Cuban cigar makers. And this is Tampa's most historic and iconic neighborhood. By day, it's charming and cultural. Brick buildings, brick streets. The trolley is going to roll right through here. And by night, it's Tampa's party zone full of bars, clubs, live music venues, places to sit outside and watch the neverending parade of interesting characters walk by. And fun fact, there's going to be lots of wild chickens that roam the streets here. And they're even protected. And serious, they have their own city ordinance, so don't mess with the roosters, okay? Oh, and this is the neighborhood where you're gonna find the Colombia, that authentic Spanish restaurant I mentioned earlier. There are a couple of other locations scattered around town, and I think there is still one in Orlando, but this one is the OG. Zoo Tampa at Lowry Park. This was voted as one of the best midsize family zoos in the US. I really like this zoo. There's a lot of shade here. It's relatively compact and super interactive. You can feed a giraffe, you can feed rhinos, you can see elephants, apes, and there's a great manity rescue and rehab center here, too. It's great for kids, and it's great for adults who want to see some animals, but they might want a less heartp pounding encounter than the roller coasters over at Busch Gardens. Armature Works. So, this place was once a trolley barn, and now it's a trendy food hall with waterfront skyline views. I like to call this place the local hipster food court, but I like this place because it's got something for everyone. Tacos, ramen, burgers, Korean sushi, beer, craft cocktails, gelato. If you're with a big group and you don't know where to eat, come here. Someone's going to find something they like. There's outdoor seating that turns this place into a really cool scene at sunset. There's a rooftop bar here. Sometimes there's live music and DJs playing tunes out here. Parking is 20 bucks, though, which Yeah. Ouch. That's pretty pricey for something like this. I actually really hate that on principal. You're paying for parking only to come inside and pay to eat. Don't love that. But if you're willing to be patient and don't mind walking a couple blocks, sometimes you can find some street parking in the nearby neighborhood. Check signs though. You don't want to park in a neighborhood you're not supposed to be. Sparkman Wararf. This is another recently revitalized waterfront spot with restaurants that are built right into shipping containers. There's outdoor seating, a beer garden, live music, and lawn games. You can come out here and play cornhole. It's great for casual bites with a view of the cruise ships and tuggos going by. I love to sit out here and just watch the boats go by. The Tampa Bay History Center. Now, this is located on the Riverwalk and this is a museum that tells the story of Tampa from the indigenous people to pirates to Cuban cigar rollers. And this museum is really underrated and underappreciated. I think it's a local gem. It really is a fantastic museum and I highly, highly recommend it. But I'm always surprised how many of my friends and other locals around here have never been there. It's a huge building downtown. You can't miss it. Go check it out, people. This place is great. I love this museum. The Seol Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. So, if you're feeling lucky, Tampa has its own little slice of Vegas right off I4. The Seol Hard Rock is actually one of the biggest casinos in the entire country. There's thousands of slot machines, table games, and one of the largest poker rooms in Florida. It's loud, it's flashy, it's packed with rock and roll memorabilia, including guitars, costumes, and outfits worn by actual rock legends. And even if you don't gamble, there's a lot to see and do in here. Multiple restaurants, a high-end steakhouse, a rooftop bar, a 24-hour diner, and live music most nights. 18:35 18:37 18:38 18:41 18:43 18:45 18:47 18:49 18:52 18:53 18:55 18:57 18:59 19:01 19:03 19:04 19:06 19:09 19:10 19:12 19:15 19:18 19:19 19:20 19:23 19:24 19:27 19:29 19:32 19:34 19:36 19:39 19:40 19:42 19:44 19:46 19:48 19:50 19:52 19:54 19:55 19:57 20:00 20:02 20:04 20:06 20:08 20:11 20:13 20:15 20:17 20:19 20:22 20:24 20:26 20:27 20:30 20:32 20:33 20:35 20:38 20:40 20:43 20:46 20:48 20:50 20:52 20:54 20:55 20:57 20:59 21:02 21:04 21:05 21:07 21:09 21:11 21:13 21:15 21:17 21:18 21:20 21:22 21:24 21:26 21:28 21:30 21:33 21:35 21:37 21:40 21:42 21:44 21:47 21:48 21:50 21:51 21:54 21:56 21:59 22:01 22:03 22:05 22:07 22:08 22:11 22:13 22:16 22:18 22:19 22:22 22:23 22:25 22:27 22:29 22:31 22:34 22:35 22:37 22:39 22:40 22:41 22:44 22:45 22:47 22:50 22:51 22:53 22:54 22:56 22:58 23:00 23:01 23:03 23:05 23:06 23:09 23:11 23:12 23:15 23:17 23:19 23:25 23:32
