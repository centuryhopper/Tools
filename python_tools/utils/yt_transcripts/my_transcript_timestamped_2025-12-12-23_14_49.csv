0:01,what is going on guys welcome back in
0:03,this video today we're going to learn
0:05,about a Linux tool called Ranger which
0:07,is a terminal based file manager and it
0:08,can be especially interesting for those
0:10,of you guys who enjoy using vim and
0:12,other terminal tools so let us get right
0:14,into
0:21,[Music]
0:23,it all right so we're going to take a
0:25,look at Ranger which is as I already
0:27,mentioned a Linux terminal based file
0:29,manager so a file manager that does not
0:31,work with a graphical user interface but
0:32,that works purely in the terminal in the
0:35,command line and the great thing about
0:36,these terminal tools and command line
0:38,tools is that they often times have a
0:40,rich set of keybinds which in the
0:42,beginning is very confusing but once you
0:44,get used to it it can massively speed up
0:47,your workflow and the best example for
0:49,this is of course Vim I have a lot of
0:51,videos on this channel about Vim about
0:53,neovim why you should use it how it
0:54,works and how you should use it how to
0:56,configure it and stuff like this and
0:59,Ranger is basically a Vim like file
1:00,manager in the command line you could
1:02,say a lot of the key binds are quite
1:04,similar and this is what we're going to
1:06,explore in this video today now the
1:08,first thing you want to do is you want
1:09,to open up a command line and you want
1:11,to install it using your package manager
1:13,so on Debian based distributions this is
1:17,pseudo app install and then Ranger in my
1:19,case this is already installed so you're
1:20,not going to see any changes being made
1:23,here uh and once you have this installed
1:25,what you can do is you can navigate to a
1:27,directory that you want to explore in my
1:29,case I have prepared here a ranger
1:30,tutorial directory so that I don't have
1:34,to uh go through my personal files here
1:36,so I'm going to go to desktop I'm going
1:39,to go to Ranger tutorial and here I can
1:42,just run the command Ranger and what you
1:45,will see here is that I have this uh
1:46,file manager here and I can go back to
1:48,the desktop and what you can see is that
1:51,you already have um a structure here you
1:54,can go through the directories on the
1:55,left side you can see the Parent
1:57,Directory on the right side you can see
1:59,a preview of what is contained in the
2:01,directory that you going to go into so
2:03,desktop for example and then you can go
2:05,into desktop then I have here Ranger
2:07,tutorial and then I have directory 1 2 3
2:09,and then I have some directories in here
2:12,as well so I can navigate through this
2:14,now one very simple way to do that is to
2:16,just use the arrow keys now this is of
2:18,course not the Vim like way to do it but
2:19,you can just use the arrow keys right to
2:22,go into something left to go back uh up
2:25,and down to just you know go up and down
2:28,um but you can also do that with enter
2:30,you can use enter to enter a direct Dory
2:32,or this is now the Vim like way is you
2:36,can use JK uh l and H so L to go into a
2:40,directory K to go up J to go down and H
2:44,to go back basically so l h to go parent
2:48,and subdirectory and then um K and J to
2:51,go up and down um but again you can also
2:53,use just the arrow keys if you want to
2:56,so basically the same as them so for
2:58,this video today I have prepared a
2:59,couple of key binds that I want to show
3:01,you you guys this list is by no means
3:04,complete so I just want to show a couple
3:05,of interesting key binds that I've
3:07,prepared here but of course the list
3:09,goes on and there are many more things
3:11,that you can do with Ranger now one very
3:13,simple thing is you can use Q to quit so
3:15,you can just use q and then you're out
3:18,of Ranger and you don't have to uh use
3:20,something like uh inm colon Q or
3:22,something like this you can just press q
3:25,and you're out of Ranger um you can also
3:28,use r or capital r to reload a directory
3:30,so if you want to reload the content
3:32,manually you can just use uppercase R
3:34,and it will reload the content off the
3:37,directory um now maybe so that we can
3:38,see we can work with something we're
3:40,going to go into a directory and when
3:42,you're inside of a directory here what
3:44,you can do is you can create new files
3:46,by just using basic commands like touch
3:48,or you can use uh make directory to make
3:50,a new directory and you do that by using
3:52,the colon which is very similar to Vim
3:55,so you just use colon uh and then you
4:00,type touch for example test.txt
4:02,and this creates now a new text file and
4:03,I can do the same thing with make
4:07,directory MK deer um my directory here
4:10,like this and then I have these new U
4:13,yeah file and directory created here and
4:14,what you can do with a file is you can
4:17,just press enter to open it in your
4:18,default editor in my case now this is
4:20,neovim I can write something like Hello
4:22,World here
4:25,um and then basically I have the content
4:27,here hello world which is also displayed
4:29,here as a preview so that is one way to
4:31,open a file now maybe you don't want to
4:33,use Vim you want to use something else
4:34,and what you can do in this case is you
4:36,can use the r key which is basically an
4:39,open withth so open with basically
4:43,meaning open with another uh editor so
4:45,for example if I press one I don't know
4:48,actually what one is uh but but you for
4:50,PDF files for example if you have a PDF
4:52,file I can create one even though it's
4:56,not going to be valid so test.pdf for
4:59,example I can just uh press enter and in
5:00,my case now this is going to of course
5:02,say it's unreadable but you can see it
5:06,opens up document viewer if I go with r
5:08,uh I can choose also different PDF
5:09,editors that I have for example I can
5:13,use one to open up ocular uh but ocular
5:14,of course is also going to have trouble
5:16,displaying the content of this file
5:18,because it's just an empty PDF file and
5:21,actually it seems like it crashes no it
5:24,doesn't crash um yeah so this is one
5:26,thing that you can do you can use the r
5:28,key to choose which tool you want to use
5:30,to open a file manual
5:31,by default it's just going to pick the
5:33,default
5:36,application um all right so other basic
5:37,commands here that you probably also
5:39,know from Vim if you're a Vim user is
5:41,you can use GG to go to the top of the
5:43,list and you can use capital G to go to
5:45,the bottom of the list is the same as in
5:48,a Vim document now let me maybe zoom in
5:50,a little bit so you can see better what
5:52,I'm doing here so again GG goes to the
5:55,top capital G goes to the bottom same as
5:57,in Vim now if you don't want to have
5:59,this uh preview perspective here where
6:00,you have the Parent Directory on the
6:02,left where you have the preview or the
6:04,subdirectory on the right what you can
6:07,do is you can use the tile waves uh the
6:11,tile wave uh key to basically switch the
6:14,The View so this this key down here in
6:16,the bottom left um and this basically
6:18,allows you
6:20,to to switch the view between the
6:24,preview View and just whatever is here
6:26,right now so this also works but of
6:28,course you can still go back and forth
6:30,with the arrow keys I prefer this view
6:32,more in my personal opinion it's better
6:35,but you can use whatever you want now
6:36,some other basic stuff that you can do
6:38,is you can rename files how do you do
6:42,that you just use CW so CW renames the
6:47,file test.txt to other file.txt for
6:50,example and as you can see it works by
6:53,the way Ranger by default also supports
6:55,uh using the mouse so you can also just
6:57,uh use the mouse to go back and forth as
7:00,you can see here uh but of of course
7:03,that goes beyond uh the the the purpose
7:05,of Ranger because the purpose of Ranger
7:08,is to use the terminal and the keyboard
7:10,essentially um well so what else we can
7:13,do is we can cut and paste so I can say
7:15,DD to cut I can go into another another
7:18,directory and I can say PP to paste so
7:20,cut and paste is basically DD like in
7:23,Vim delete and at the same time cut and
7:26,PP to paste in another um in another
7:29,directory I can also yank a file so I
7:31,can say y y which is the copy line in
7:34,Vim I can go back and I can say PP again
7:36,and then I have a copy of other file
7:40,here and I didn't cut it I just copied
7:43,it so that's simple um also what I have
7:47,here is I have uh a DD command so D
7:49,capital D which is basically deleting it
7:51,so D and capital D you can see here the
7:54,different options once I press D with
7:56,capital D I get console delete it asks
7:59,me here to execute this command and
8:01,delete deleting other file succeeded now
8:03,what's interesting is that when I say
8:09,file 1.txt and then file 2.txt when I
8:11,create multiple files and I want to
8:13,delete multiple of these files what I
8:15,can do is I can select them I can mark
8:17,them or Mark is actually something else
8:20,I can select them uh with space for
8:25,example and then I can say uh d
8:28,d and then it asks me to confirm the
8:30,deletion because now I have multiple
8:32,files in this case I have to say yes and
8:34,then it deletes both files uh I think
8:37,the same is true if you have a directory
8:39,let's see if that's the case touch
8:40,file.txt
8:43,when I go back and I try to delete the
8:45,directory it will ask me for the
8:47,deletion even though it's One Directory
8:49,the directory contains multiple files so
8:52,it asks me for confirmation now an
8:55,alternative to that is to use D capital
8:57,T which basically moves it to the trash
9:00,Now what is important here is that by
9:03,default this has its own implementation
9:07,so DT um actually has an implementation
9:10,in Ranger in and off itself but in my
9:12,case I overwrote that implementation
9:13,because it caused some problems which
9:15,brings us to the next point you can
9:17,actually configure Ranger customly and
9:19,how you do that is you go to the config
9:23,directory so um user directory and then
9:28,doc config and then uh Ranger I
9:30,think and here you have to create a file
9:34,rc.com and in my case I have here uh a
9:37,mapping mapping DT to this command here
9:40,basically shell move and then whatever
9:44,the file is to home username local share
9:47,trash file so basically move it to the
9:49,to the trash but in this case also I
9:51,don't get uh the
9:55,question uh of whether I want to to
9:57,confirm the deletion it just deletes it
10:00,which is because I have my own command
10:03,here so let's go back to our directory
10:05,Ranger so that's what you can do you can
10:08,delete you can move to trash um by
10:10,default it should have already the the
10:11,functionality to move the trash but in
10:14,my case it didn't work for some reason
10:16,um but yeah what else we can do is we
10:18,can Mark files in different ways so I
10:20,can touch again here file
10:22,one.txt
10:29,and then file 2.txt and then file 3.txt
10:31,and instead of just using space to Mark
10:33,individual files or to select individual
10:35,files I can also use something like the
10:37,Vim visual line mode so I can use shift
10:42,and V to open up visual mode
10:45,basically um and then uh I can also use
10:47,V to select everything or to toggle the
10:49,selection of everything so I can use
10:51,just V itself to select everything
10:53,that's not selected and to unselect
10:55,everything that is selected which in
10:59,this case results in this and yeah then
11:02,I can do again uh some operations now
11:04,one thing that is interesting is I can
11:06,do a bulk rename so basically if I have
11:09,file one file 2 file 3 .txt selected
11:11,what I can now do is I can run the
11:15,command with colon bulk rename and then
11:18,percent s and what this does is it opens
11:20,up a neovim instance in my case so
11:24,basically your editor and um it gives
11:25,you the file names here and you can
11:27,manipulate them so for example I can go
11:29,into visual block mode I can remove the
11:32,txt and I can replace it with PNG for
11:36,example that is um a basic renaming that
11:38,I can do here and now I can write this I
11:40,can write and quit I can write and quit
11:42,again or actually just quit uh and then
11:45,you can see renamed file one txt to file
11:49,one PNG File 2 txt File 2 PNG and so on
11:51,and now they have different different
11:53,file names which of course in this case
11:54,doesn't make sense because they're not
11:57,images but this is a feature that you
12:00,can also use your bulk renaming
12:02,um all right so other basic things that
12:04,we can do is we can use a basic search
12:06,using slash the same way we do it in
12:08,viim so just slash and then for example
12:11,file and in this case it's going to jump
12:12,to something that contains file I can
12:16,use n to go to the next and capital N to
12:20,go to the previous one so basically if I
12:22,let's maybe create
12:26,some some other file.txt here again and
12:31,maybe also touch test .txt now when I am
12:33,somewhere here I can look now for file
12:36,and then it will allow me to iterate
12:38,over all the results to contain file I
12:40,can also go back with capital n and then
12:43,I can maybe go for slash test and then I
12:46,will only find the test uh the files
12:49,that contain the string test so yeah
12:52,this is a basic search and n and capital
12:55,N are for next and previous uh we also
12:58,have the ability to go uh back in
13:01,history and forward in history with
13:04,Capital H and capital L now this will
13:06,often times just be the same as using H
13:09,and L but if you jump somewhere uh this
13:11,will allow you to go back and forth in
13:12,history and how can you jump somewhere
13:15,let's say for example I want to Let's
13:18,create a subdirectory here sub deer and
13:20,in that subdirectory I want to have a
13:21,file
13:26,touch uh touch my file.txt what I can do
13:28,now is I can set a waypoint here or a
13:32,mark I can Mark a waypoint um or I can
13:34,set a mark for this specific location
13:36,that I'm currently at and I can do that
13:38,in the same way I do it in Bim by just
13:41,saying ma a for example ma marks this
13:45,particular location as the the mark a so
13:48,I can go now somewhere else here for
13:51,example uh and now I can jump back to
13:54,the mark a by using a single quotation
13:55,mark so just a single
14:00,quotation um and then a like this and I
14:02,can use the single quotation twice to go
14:06,back to the last point before the jump
14:08,and the good thing is that I can
14:11,actually uh you can see here when I
14:13,press just the single quotation mark it
14:15,shows me what kind of way points or what
14:18,kind of marks I already have you can see
14:20,I have a and I have t for trash and now
14:23,I can go back here and create
14:27,maybe another Mark here let's call it G
14:30,and now when I use single quotation you
14:32,can see I have a mark G which I can jump
14:35,to I can jump to a I can jump to g a g
14:37,and so on uh and of course I can also
14:41,remove a mark so I can say um what was
14:45,it I think it was u m and then I can I
14:48,can remove the mark uh G for example and
14:49,then when I try to use single quotation
14:52,G is no longer there so that's also
14:55,quite useful um also what I can do is I
15:00,can sort so I can uh sort the files that
15:02,I have here based on a certain pattern I
15:04,do this with the key o and you can see I
15:06,have different uh ways to sort this so
15:09,one thing is I can use the base name B
15:11,which is the default here sort it by
15:14,name basically but I can also sort by uh
15:16,creation time so a and this basically
15:19,sorted by the time uh or access time I'm
15:22,not sure let's see what does it say a
15:24,time I think it's access time and C time
15:26,is creation time in this case it should
15:29,be the same um but yeah can see here I
15:31,can sort by different things size is
15:34,also a thing and type is a thing so
15:36,maybe if I actually it's already sorted
15:39,by type but yeah alphabetically as you
15:41,can see here uh so that is something we
15:43,can do we can also do something simple
15:45,like change mode I can use just minus or
15:49,Dash or also plus to change the mode of
15:50,this particular
15:54,file um yeah that's that's also a thing
15:56,that I can do and maybe last but not
15:57,least what we can do is we can see the
16:00,dis usage so I can see say du and it
16:02,basically shows me the dis usage of uh
16:05,this directory I can go back here and I
16:08,can say du and you can see or maybe I
16:12,should uh go within du it shows me how
16:14,much space the individual directories in
16:16,the current directory take
16:19,up um so yeah there's much more to do
16:20,here much more to learn here but that's
16:23,just a very nice file manager for the
16:24,terminal because often times you don't
16:26,want to use a graphical user interface
16:28,you don't want to use your mouse and
16:30,once you get comfortable using these key
16:32,binds once you integrate them into your
16:34,workflow the same way that at least I've
16:36,done it with Vim Vim is something that
16:38,comes very naturally to me already
16:41,Ranger is not yet uh but once you have
16:42,this in your workflow this is massively
16:45,going to speed up your productivity
16:48,because you can easily just use some key
16:50,binds that are already automatic in your
16:52,brain and you can get things done very
16:54,quickly now one thing that I forgot to
16:57,show you is you can also enable um you
16:59,can also show hidden files hidden
17:01,directories so maybe we can create one
17:05,touch test. test and this is now a
17:06,hidden file I I'm not sure if it was
17:08,created or not but you can display
17:12,hidden files by uh using the keybind zh
17:15,Z shows now all the hidden files I can
17:18,create some more touch test two or
17:19,something then I can also touch just
17:23,test uh and when I now say Z again it
17:27,will hide the hidden files as you can
17:30,see uh all right so that is Ranger and I
17:31,think it's a very nice tool you might
17:33,want to take a look at it so that's it
