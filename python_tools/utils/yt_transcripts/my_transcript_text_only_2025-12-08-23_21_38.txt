I love this dish because it's like a summertime palette cleanser. It's loaded with healthy ingredients and tastes absolutely delicious. You might have heard that you shouldn't consume fruit in juice form because it strips away all the fiber and lets your body absorb sugar unnaturally fast. This is all true, but it doesn't apply to smoothies. The key difference is that for smoothies, you don't remove the solid parts of the fruits and vegetables. You just blend them all together. This means you still get their natural fiber content, which regulates sugar absorption, feeds your gut microbiota, and prevents inflammation. In fact, adding vegetables, nuts, and fats to your smoothie dilutes the sugar content of the fruit, slowing down absorption even more and keeping you full for longer. All right, let's get going. First, add in your macadamia nut. Adding the liquid first stops your ingredients from stalling the blender. Next, add in one banana, frozen if possible, to thicken the consistency of the smoothie. Then add in the rest of your ingredients. Mac nuts, three frozen cherries, pomegranate seeds, hemp seeds, wheat grass, vanilla extract, chia seeds, juice of half of a lemon, and one celery stock. These were all chosen for a reason. Pomegranates have unique polyphenols that protects your cholesterol from oxidation, which all improves your blood flow. Dark cherries have another distinct type of elite polyphenols that help with cardiovascular health and are rich in melatonin, which helps with sleep. Hemp seeds are a great source of essential omega-3 and omega6 fat with a remarkable 32% protein content. Close the lid and give everything a good blend for 30 seconds. Next, add in a handful or two of washed spinach and blend again until all your ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Take your glass and serve your smoothie. Note that this will be a thicker smoothie. If you want to make it less thick, you can always add in more filtered water or your choice of nutmilk. Top off with a little strawberry and mint and you're ready to go. This is a great meal prep smoothie. You can make a big batch and store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 3 to 4 days. Just make sure to give it a quick stir or shake before enjoying. 9:26 9:28 9:31 9:32 9:36 9:39 9:40 9:42 9:44 9:46 9:48 9:50 9:53 9:54 9:56 9:58 10:00 10:02 10:04 10:09 10:11 10:14 10:16 10:18 10:21 10:23 10:25 10:28 10:30 10:32 10:33 10:35 10:37 10:39 10:41 10:43 10:46 10:48 10:50 10:54 10:56 10:58 11:00 11:02 11:05 11:08 11:11 11:15 11:21 11:23 11:26 11:27 11:31 11:33 11:35 11:37 11:40 11:42 11:44 11:46 11:48 11:50 11:51 11:53 11:55 11:58 12:00 12:02 12:04 12:06 12:10 12:12 12:14 12:16 12:18 12:21 12:24 12:27 12:30 12:33 12:35 12:37 12:39 12:42 12:44 12:47 12:49 12:51 12:54 12:56 12:59 13:01 13:03 13:06 13:08 13:10 13:12 13:15 13:17 13:19 13:21 13:23 13:25 13:27 13:30 13:32 13:34
