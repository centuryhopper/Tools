Transcript what is going on guys welcome back in this video today we're going to learn about a Linux tool called Ranger which is a terminal based file manager and it can be especially interesting for those of you guys who enjoy using vim and other terminal tools so let us get right into [Music] it all right so we're going to take a look at Ranger which is as I already mentioned a Linux terminal based file manager so a file manager that does not work with a graphical user interface but that works purely in the terminal in the command line and the great thing about these terminal tools and command line tools is that they often times have a rich set of keybinds which in the beginning is very confusing but once you get used to it it can massively speed up your workflow and the best example for this is of course Vim I have a lot of videos on this channel about Vim about neovim why you should use it how it works and how you should use it how to configure it and stuff like this and Ranger is basically a Vim like file manager in the command line you could say a lot of the key binds are quite similar and this is what we're going to explore in this video today now the first thing you want to do is you want to open up a command line and you want to install it using your package manager so on Debian based distributions this is pseudo app install and then Ranger in my case this is already installed so you're not going to see any changes being made here uh and once you have this installed what you can do is you can navigate to a directory that you want to explore in my case I have prepared here a ranger tutorial directory so that I don't have to uh go through my personal files here so I'm going to go to desktop I'm going to go to Ranger tutorial and here I can just run the command Ranger and what you will see here is that I have this uh file manager here and I can go back to the desktop and what you can see is that you already have um a structure here you can go through the directories on the left side you can see the Parent Directory on the right side you can see a preview of what is contained in the directory that you going to go into so desktop for example and then you can go into desktop then I have here Ranger tutorial and then I have directory 1 2 3 and then I have some directories in here as well so I can navigate through this now one very simple way to do that is to just use the arrow keys now this is of course not the Vim like way to do it but you can just use the arrow keys right to go into something left to go back uh up and down to just you know go up and down um but you can also do that with enter you can use enter to enter a direct Dory or this is now the Vim like way is you can use JK uh l and H so L to go into a directory K to go up J to go down and H to go back basically so l h to go parent and subdirectory and then um K and J to go up and down um but again you can also use just the arrow keys if you want to so basically the same as them so for this video today I have prepared a couple of key binds that I want to show you you guys this list is by no means complete so I just want to show a couple of interesting key binds that I've prepared here but of course the list goes on and there are many more things that you can do with Ranger now one very simple thing is you can use Q to quit so you can just use q and then you're out of Ranger and you don't have to uh use something like uh inm colon Q or something like this you can just press q and you're out of Ranger um you can also use r or capital r to reload a directory so if you want to reload the content manually you can just use uppercase R and it will reload the content off the directory um now maybe so that we can see we can work with something we're going to go into a directory and when you're inside of a directory here what you can do is you can create new files by just using basic commands like touch or you can use uh make directory to make a new directory and you do that by using the colon which is very similar to Vim so you just use colon uh and then you type touch for example test.txt and this creates now a new text file and I can do the same thing with make directory MK deer um my directory here like this and then I have these new U yeah file and directory created here and what you can do with a file is you can just press enter to open it in your default editor in my case now this is neovim I can write something like Hello World here um and then basically I have the content here hello world which is also displayed here as a preview so that is one way to open a file now maybe you don't want to use Vim you want to use something else and what you can do in this case is you can use the r key which is basically an open withth so open with basically meaning open with another uh editor so for example if I press one I don't know actually what one is uh but but you for PDF files for example if you have a PDF file I can create one even though it's not going to be valid so test.pdf for example I can just uh press enter and in my case now this is going to of course say it's unreadable but you can see it opens up document viewer if I go with r uh I can choose also different PDF editors that I have for example I can use one to open up ocular uh but ocular of course is also going to have trouble displaying the content of this file because it's just an empty PDF file and actually it seems like it crashes no it doesn't crash um yeah so this is one thing that you can do you can use the r key to choose which tool you want to use to open a file manual by default it's just going to pick the default application um all right so other basic commands here that you probably also know from Vim if you're a Vim user is you can use GG to go to the top of the list and you can use capital G to go to the bottom of the list is the same as in a Vim document now let me maybe zoom in a little bit so you can see better what I'm doing here so again GG goes to the top capital G goes to the bottom same as in Vim now if you don't want to have this uh preview perspective here where you have the Parent Directory on the left where you have the preview or the subdirectory on the right what you can do is you can use the tile waves uh the tile wave uh key to basically switch the The View so this this key down here in the bottom left um and this basically allows you to to switch the view between the preview View and just whatever is here right now so this also works but of course you can still go back and forth with the arrow keys I prefer this view more in my personal opinion it's better but you can use whatever you want now some other basic stuff that you can do is you can rename files how do you do that you just use CW so CW renames the file test.txt to other file.txt for example and as you can see it works by the way Ranger by default also supports uh using the mouse so you can also just uh use the mouse to go back and forth as you can see here uh but of of course that goes beyond uh the the the purpose of Ranger because the purpose of Ranger is to use the terminal and the keyboard essentially um well so what else we can do is we can cut and paste so I can say DD to cut I can go into another another directory and I can say PP to paste so cut and paste is basically DD like in Vim delete and at the same time cut and PP to paste in another um in another directory I can also yank a file so I can say y y which is the copy line in Vim I can go back and I can say PP again and then I have a copy of other file here and I didn't cut it I just copied it so that's simple um also what I have here is I have uh a DD command so D capital D which is basically deleting it so D and capital D you can see here the different options once I press D with capital D I get console delete it asks me here to execute this command and delete deleting other file succeeded now what's interesting is that when I say file 1.txt and then file 2.txt when I create multiple files and I want to delete multiple of these files what I can do is I can select them I can mark them or Mark is actually something else I can select them uh with space for example and then I can say uh d d and then it asks me to confirm the deletion because now I have multiple files in this case I have to say yes and then it deletes both files uh I think the same is true if you have a directory let's see if that's the case touch file.txt when I go back and I try to delete the directory it will ask me for the deletion even though it's One Directory the directory contains multiple files so it asks me for confirmation now an alternative to that is to use D capital T which basically moves it to the trash Now what is important here is that by default this has its own implementation so DT um actually has an implementation in Ranger in and off itself but in my case I overwrote that implementation because it caused some problems which brings us to the next point you can actually configure Ranger customly and how you do that is you go to the config directory so um user directory and then doc config and then uh Ranger I think and here you have to create a file rc.com and in my case I have here uh a mapping mapping DT to this command here basically shell move and then whatever the file is to home username local share trash file so basically move it to the to the trash but in this case also I don't get uh the question uh of whether I want to to confirm the deletion it just deletes it which is because I have my own command here so let's go back to our directory Ranger so that's what you can do you can delete you can move to trash um by default it should have already the the functionality to move the trash but in my case it didn't work for some reason um but yeah what else we can do is we can Mark files in different ways so I can touch again here file one.txt and then file 2.txt and then file 3.txt and instead of just using space to Mark individual files or to select individual files I can also use something like the Vim visual line mode so I can use shift and V to open up visual mode basically um and then uh I can also use V to select everything or to toggle the selection of everything so I can use just V itself to select everything that's not selected and to unselect everything that is selected which in this case results in this and yeah then I can do again uh some operations now one thing that is interesting is I can do a bulk rename so basically if I have file one file 2 file 3 .txt selected what I can now do is I can run the command with colon bulk rename and then percent s and what this does is it opens up a neovim instance in my case so basically your editor and um it gives you the file names here and you can manipulate them so for example I can go into visual block mode I can remove the txt and I can replace it with PNG for example that is um a basic renaming that I can do here and now I can write this I can write and quit I can write and quit again or actually just quit uh and then you can see renamed file one txt to file one PNG File 2 txt File 2 PNG and so on and now they have different different file names which of course in this case doesn't make sense because they're not images but this is a feature that you can also use your bulk renaming um all right so other basic things that we can do is we can use a basic search using slash the same way we do it in viim so just slash and then for example file and in this case it's going to jump to something that contains file I can use n to go to the next and capital N to go to the previous one so basically if I let's maybe create some some other file.txt here again and maybe also touch test .txt now when I am somewhere here I can look now for file and then it will allow me to iterate over all the results to contain file I can also go back with capital n and then I can maybe go for slash test and then I will only find the test uh the files that contain the string test so yeah this is a basic search and n and capital N are for next and previous uh we also have the ability to go uh back in history and forward in history with Capital H and capital L now this will often times just be the same as using H and L but if you jump somewhere uh this will allow you to go back and forth in history and how can you jump somewhere let's say for example I want to Let's create a subdirectory here sub deer and in that subdirectory I want to have a file touch uh touch my file.txt what I can do now is I can set a waypoint here or a mark I can Mark a waypoint um or I can set a mark for this specific location that I'm currently at and I can do that in the same way I do it in Bim by just saying ma a for example ma marks this particular location as the the mark a so I can go now somewhere else here for example uh and now I can jump back to the mark a by using a single quotation mark so just a single quotation um and then a like this and I can use the single quotation twice to go back to the last point before the jump and the good thing is that I can actually uh you can see here when I press just the single quotation mark it shows me what kind of way points or what kind of marks I already have you can see I have a and I have t for trash and now I can go back here and create maybe another Mark here let's call it G and now when I use single quotation you can see I have a mark G which I can jump to I can jump to a I can jump to g a g and so on uh and of course I can also remove a mark so I can say um what was it I think it was u m and then I can I can remove the mark uh G for example and then when I try to use single quotation G is no longer there so that's also quite useful um also what I can do is I can sort so I can uh sort the files that I have here based on a certain pattern I do this with the key o and you can see I have different uh ways to sort this so one thing is I can use the base name B which is the default here sort it by name basically but I can also sort by uh creation time so a and this basically sorted by the time uh or access time I'm not sure let's see what does it say a time I think it's access time and C time is creation time in this case it should be the same um but yeah can see here I can sort by different things size is also a thing and type is a thing so maybe if I actually it's already sorted by type but yeah alphabetically as you can see here uh so that is something we can do we can also do something simple like change mode I can use just minus or Dash or also plus to change the mode of this particular file um yeah that's that's also a thing that I can do and maybe last but not least what we can do is we can see the dis usage so I can see say du and it basically shows me the dis usage of uh this directory I can go back here and I can say du and you can see or maybe I should uh go within du it shows me how much space the individual directories in the current directory take up um so yeah there's much more to do here much more to learn here but that's just a very nice file manager for the terminal because often times you don't want to use a graphical user interface you don't want to use your mouse and once you get comfortable using these key binds once you integrate them into your workflow the same way that at least I've done it with Vim Vim is something that comes very naturally to me already Ranger is not yet uh but once you have this in your workflow this is massively going to speed up your productivity because you can easily just use some key binds that are already automatic in your brain and you can get things done very quickly now one thing that I forgot to show you is you can also enable um you can also show hidden files hidden directories so maybe we can create one touch test. test and this is now a hidden file I I'm not sure if it was created or not but you can display hidden files by uh using the keybind zh Z shows now all the hidden files I can create some more touch test two or something then I can also touch just test uh and when I now say Z again it will hide the hidden files as you can see uh all right so that is Ranger and I think it's a very nice tool you might want to take a look at it so that's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it and hope you learned something if so let me know by hitting a like button and leaving a
