"Welcome to Tampa, Florida, a city where",0:00
"you can ride a roller coaster, eat a",0:02
"Cuban sandwich, and spot a wild chicken",0:04
"in the streets, all before lunch. This",0:06
"is where I live. And in this video, I'm",0:09
going to show you around just a little,0:10
"bit, and break down everything you need",0:12
"to know to plan the perfect Tampa trip,",0:14
"including how to get here, how to get",0:16
"around, where to stay, what to eat, and",0:17
"of course, some of the best things to do",0:20
in and around the city. Let's go.,0:22
0:26,Tampa Airport
0:28,"If you're flying in, well, you're in"
0:30,luck because Tampa International Airport
0:32,is consistently ranked as one of the
0:34,"best airports in the country. Yeah, the"
0:36,whole country. And I really strongly
0:39,agree. This is a great airport and it's
0:41,kind of a big point of local pride
0:43,around here. We love this airport around
0:46,here. It's just about 15 to 20 minutes
0:47,"or so, give or take, depending on"
0:50,traffic from downtown. And it's
0:52,shockingly efficient. like you're off
0:54,"the plane, you've grabbed your luggage,"
0:56,and you're in your Uber in under 20
0:58,"minutes, efficient. And if you think I'm"
1:00,"exaggerating, I'm really not. This is"
1:02,easily one of the best designed airports
1:03,"in the world. And it's really, really"
1:05,easy to navigate quickly and find your
1:07,"way around. And if you're here, don't"
1:09,forget to say hi to Phoebe the Flamingo
1:11,while you're here. This incredible
1:12,sculpture right here in the main
1:14,concourse has quickly become a local
1:16,"icon, and it's great for your Instagram,"
1:18,too.
1:20,"Once here, your main options from the"
1:22,"airport are going to be renting a car,"
1:24,probably the best way to explore the
1:26,area. This isn't really a great city for
1:28,"public transport, if I'm being honest, a"
1:30,"ride share or taxi, or a hotel shuttle"
1:32,if you're staying nearby. And if you're
1:34,"heading into town for a cruise, Port"
1:36,"Tampa Bay is right next to downtown. So,"
1:38,you're just steps away from all the
1:40,action with lots of places to stay and
Transportation,things to do right there.
"Now, Tampa is unfortunately not one of",1:42
those cities that's really easy to get,1:44
around if you don't have a car. Some,1:46
"neighborhoods are kind of walkable, like",1:48
"downtown and Eore City, but a lot of the",1:50
"cool stuff is spread out, and the city",1:52
is pretty lacking when it comes to,1:55
public transportation. Here's a not so,1:56
fun fact. Tampa Bay is the second,1:59
largest metro area in the entire country,2:01
without any form of commuter rail. No,2:04
"light rail, no nothing. Detroit is",2:06
number one. That's something I really,2:09
wish we could do better around here. And,2:11
"yeah, there is the Tikol Line street car",2:13
"downtown, which is this little trolley",2:15
line that runs between downtown Tampa,2:17
and Eore City. And that is an option if,2:19
you're going to be down there in that,2:22
"area, but it's honestly more of a",2:23
novelty and it's not really meant for,2:25
serious commuting or getting around the,2:27
city at large. It's more of a cute,2:28
little tourist attraction that's fun to,2:30
"ride and fun to see rolling around town,",2:32
"but it is free though, absolutely free.",2:34
"So, that's pretty cool. And if you're",2:36
"driving, parking at meters or in parking",2:39
garages around town is surprisingly,2:41
reasonable. Compared to other big,2:43
"cities, it's really not that expensive",2:45
"to park around here. So, I honestly",2:46
can't complain too much about what,2:49
parking costs most of the time. If,2:50
you're parking near Amily Arena when,2:53
there's a lightning game or a concert,2:55
"happening, it might cost you a lot more.",2:56
3:00,Where to Stay
3:01,"So, let's talk about where you might"
3:04,want to stay. This city is made up of a
3:05,"bunch of different neighborhoods, each"
3:07,"with its own vibe, personality, and"
3:08,proximity to the stuff you'll actually
3:11,want to do. Downtown is relatively
3:13,"walkable, and it's near museums, the"
3:15,"Riverwalk, Amaly Arena, Sparkman Wararf,"
3:18,and the Cruise Port. It is a pretty safe
3:20,"downtown for the most part, but you"
3:21,"know, just use common sense like you"
3:24,"would anywhere else. And of course, your"
3:26,idea of walkable might be a lot
3:27,different than other people's in the
3:28,"middle of the summer when it's really,"
3:31,really hot out here. Downtown is going
3:33,"to be best for firsttime visitors,"
3:34,"cruisers, people who are going to events"
3:36,"or conventions, or anybody without a"
3:39,car. And some hotels you might want to
3:40,check out are going to be the Hyatt
3:42,"Place downtown, the Hotel Tampa"
3:43,"Riverwalk, which is right along the"
3:45,"river there, and the Water Street"
3:48,Marriott. This is a really big hotel
3:49,right on the water downtown that's
3:51,really popular for big events like
3:54,Gasparilla. That's Tampa's biggest event
3:56,of the year. It's kind of like Martyra
3:58,meets Pirates. Happens every January.
4:00,Hundreds of boats and thousands of
4:02,pirates invade the bay and it's followed
4:04,by one of the biggest parades in the
4:06,entire country right down Beayshore
4:08,"Boulevard. Then a few weeks later, we do"
4:10,it all over again. This time at night in
4:12,Eore City. This thing is a Tampa
4:14,institution.
4:17,Eore City is artsy. It's historic and
4:19,it's alive with nightife. I would
4:21,describe 7th Avenue here as kind of like
4:24,Tampa's version of Bourbon Street in New
4:27,Orleans. Lots of bars and clubs lining
4:28,the road here. This is an area that was
4:30,first settled by Cuban immigrants with
4:32,"old cigar factories, cool old brick"
4:34,"buildings, and even a tiny little park"
4:36,that's still owned by the Cuban
4:38,"government today, and it is considered"
4:40,"Cuban soil. So, when you step in here,"
4:44,you are technically technically in Cuba.
4:46,And there are wild chickens running
4:47,around Eore all over the place. They're
4:49,basically like our little beloved local
4:51,"mascots,"
4:53,but Eore does have kind of a mixed
4:54,reputation. There's a lot of bars and
4:56,clubs here and depending on what kind of
4:57,person you are and what kind of vibe
4:59,"you're after, you may either love it"
5:02,here or hate it here. But it is a really
5:03,different scene during the day. So come
5:05,out and check it out during the day if
5:06,you're curious but don't want to deal
5:08,with the party scene.
5:10,"This area is best for history buffs,"
5:11,"night owls, and anyone looking for a"
5:13,little bit of character. You might want
5:15,to check out the Hotel Ha. It's a
5:17,stylish boutique hotel right here on 7th
5:20,"Avenue. But heads up, Eore can be loud"
5:21,"at night, especially on weekends. So"
5:24,keep that in mind when booking.
5:26,West Shore is the neighborhood near the
5:27,"airport with a lot of shopping malls,"
5:30,"chain hotels, chain restaurants. Easy"
5:32,"access to everything, though. It's not"
5:34,"super scenic, but it is really"
5:35,convenient. And if you're planning a
5:37,"beach day, this area is pretty close to"
5:38,the bridges. They're going to take you
5:41,over the bay into Penllis County. This
5:42,area is probably going to be best for
5:44,"business travelers, those with early"
5:45,flights. They want quick access to the
5:48,airport or quick overnight trips.
5:51,And South Tampa is a leafy upscale
5:53,residential area with historic
5:54,neighborhoods like Hide Park and
5:56,Beayshore. It's where you'll find
5:58,"boutique shops, historic homes,"
6:00,"expensive homes, some big mansions along"
6:02,"the water right here, and one of the"
6:04,longest continuous sidewalks in the
6:06,"world, Beayshore Boulevard. Now, Tampa"
6:08,likes to claim it's the longest sidewalk
6:10,"in the world at 4 and 1/2 miles, and you"
6:12,"will see that a lot of places, but I"
6:14,have read that there's a longer one over
6:16,"in Galveastston, Texas that's like 10 mi"
6:18,"long. So, this one might be up for"
6:20,"debate, but it is great for joggers, dog"
6:22,"walkers, and anyone who enjoys a scenic"
6:24,waterfront view of downtown. This is an
6:26,area worth looking at if you want a more
6:28,"local, laid-back vibe with quick access"
6:31,to downtown. Check out the Epicurian
6:32,Hotel. It's a boutique hotel right
6:34,across from Burn Steakhouse. We're going
6:36,to talk about them next. And the
6:39,Sailport Waterfront Suites. But no
6:40,"matter where you're going to stay, book"
6:41,early. If you're coming for a big event
6:43,"like Gas Barilla, a big concert, or a"
What to Eat,"convention, the good spots do go fast."
"So, what to eat while you're here? Now,",6:47
Tampa doesn't usually get a lot of,6:49
"credit as a foodie city, but I think it",6:51
"should. It's pretty underrated, actually",6:54
in that department. Let's start with the,6:55
"big one, the famous Cuban sandwich. Now,",6:57
the Cuban sandwich can be a surprisingly,7:00
contentious topic among Florida food,7:02
"purists. Usually, the debate involves",7:04
whether or not salami belongs on there.,7:06
"In Miami, the answer is usually going to",7:09
be no. But Tampa is pro salami when it,7:12
"comes to Cubans, and that's how it's",7:14
usually going to be made around here.,7:16
But let's leave that argument to the,7:18
food snobs. These are delicious either,7:20
way you make them. Some of the best,7:22
places to have a Cuban here are going to,7:24
be the Columbia Restaurant. This is,7:25
Florida's oldest restaurant. It opened,7:27
back in 1905. It's an authentic Spanish,7:29
restaurant known for their paella and,7:32
their famous 1905 salad. They even have,7:34
flamco shows in here. Lasagunda Central,7:36
Bakery opened way back in 1915. Another,7:40
old place that's still handmaking Cuban,7:42
bread daily right here. And they also,7:45
serve a killer Cuban.,7:47
And another contender and my personal,7:49
favorite in the great Cuban sandwich war,7:51
is the West Tampa sandwich shop. This is,7:53
"a very nondescript, very nonp",7:56
pretentious little hole in the wall that,7:58
serves up killer food. If you're looking,8:00
"for seafood, ulele down along the",8:02
riverwalk serves Native Americanins,8:04
inspired dishes with local ingredients,8:06
and a killer riverside patio and a,8:08
really cool outdoor bar. The Rusty,8:10
Pelican and Oyster Catchers are some,8:12
great places to check out for waterfront,8:14
views and seafood. Looking for something,8:16
a little bit more casual? Some local,8:18
favorites are going to be the Oxford,8:19
"Exchange. This place is casual, but it's",8:21
"also kind of bougie, and it's not really",8:23
"my scene personally, but a lot of people",8:25
"here love this place, so maybe I'm the",8:28
one that's wrong. A few more local,8:30
casual places worth checking out are,8:32
going to be Daily Eats. This is a diner,8:34
"style place that's great for brunch,",8:37
"breakfast, or breakfast for dinner. The",8:38
Independent and Seminal Heights has,8:41
"great sandwiches, craft beer, and a",8:42
chill local vibe. Kind of like a gastro,8:44
pub. And if you're looking for some good,8:47
"pizza, downtown Eddie and Sam's New York",8:49
pizza actually ships its water in from,8:52
New York for that authentic New York,8:54
style pizza dough. And a place that I,8:56
think is a lot of fun is Gen X Tavern.,8:58
It's also downtown. This is a 1980s,9:00
"themed bar. Good beer selection, good",9:03
"food, cool vibes. If you're a foodie",9:05
looking for something maybe a little bit,9:08
"more upscale, a little bit more unique,",9:09
the Rooster and the Till is a big foodie,9:11
go-to around here. It's got a Michelin,9:13
"Gourand Award, whatever that means",9:15
exactly. Known for creative small,9:18
"plates, seasonal ingredients, and big",9:20
"prices. If I'm being honest, Misison",9:22
Plus downtown is a longtime favorite for,9:24
fine dining with a Fidian twist. They,9:26
kind of do this modern American French,9:28
fusion thing down there. Edison near the,9:30
University of Tampa is creative but,9:33
without the pretentiousness. And CW's,9:35
gin joint downtown has kind of an old,9:37
school speak easyy atmosphere. Live,9:39
"jazz, craft cocktails, upscale food,",9:41
"upscale prices, too. And if you want a",9:44
steakhouse with a seafood twist and,9:46
"white tablecloths, Ocean Prime is a",9:48
really popular spot. And if you're into,9:51
"craft beer, Tampa is a great town. We",9:52
take it pretty seriously around here.,9:54
It's got a great beer scene. Cigar City,9:56
Brewing is the big one. Their Highi IPA,9:58
is everywhere. They have relatively,10:00
recently moved their main brewing,10:03
"facility up to North Carolina, which a",10:04
"lot of us are pretty salty about, but",10:06
the tap room here is still open. Copper,10:07
Tale Brewing in Eore has a great tap,10:10
"room, great artwork, and great food,",10:12
too. Angry Chair is where you want to go,10:14
if you're into dark beers and dessert,10:16
stouts that taste like liquid brownies.,10:17
And that's pretty refreshing in a scene,10:20
that can be overly dominated by IPAs.,10:21
Berry House Brewing specializes in,10:24
loggers and German style brews. I really,10:26
like them. Magnanimous Brewing near,10:28
Armature Works does some really creative,10:30
stuff. The Tamp Brewing Company in Eore,10:32
City is one of the first craft breweries,10:34
in the area. They've been doing this,10:36
since way before it was cool. Great beer,10:37
in there and a killer burger menu. I,10:40
really love their burgers there. And if,10:42
you want to sip a local brew while,10:44
"playing some old school arcade games,",10:45
check out the Lowry Parcade. This isn't,10:47
"a brewery, but it's part beer bar, part",10:49
retro gaming arcade. And for just eight,10:52
"bucks, you can play as many games as you",10:54
want. Great place to nerd out and chill.,10:56
Love that place.,10:58
But if you ask anybody around what they,11:01
"think is Tampa's most iconic, most",11:03
"famous restaurant, most of them are",11:05
probably going to tell you it's Burns,11:07
Steakhouse. This place in South Tampa is,11:09
an institution. Like when presidents,11:12
"come to visit Tampa, because McDale Air",11:14
"Force Base is just down the street,",11:16
they're going to go here. It's always in,11:18
the conversation among some of the best,11:20
"steakous in the entire world. Yeah, the",11:22
whole world. And it boasts the biggest,11:24
wine selection in the world. Very famous,11:26
for their wine. They have a seller here,11:29
that has thousands of bottles down,11:31
there. And you can take a free tour of,11:33
the seller and the kitchen to see all,11:34
the behind the scenes here after your,11:36
meal. They're going to ask you after,11:37
your meal. The waiter is going to come,11:39
"right up and say, ""Hey, you want a tour?",11:40
"You don't even need to ask."" Burns",11:42
really is truly special. It's a great,11:44
place for a big night out. The food and,11:46
"service is impeccable, but it's not",11:48
snoody or pretentious either. There is,11:50
"this kind of self-aware, kitschy vibe in",11:53
here because the decor and atmosphere is,11:55
so over-the-top. It's like exactly what,11:58
you imagine an extremely fancy and,12:00
expensive restaurant looks like when you,12:02
were like 11 years old. But do give,12:04
yourself at least a few hours if you,12:06
decide to eat here. The whole thing is,12:08
an experience and definitely do not show,12:10
up without reservations.,12:12
12:16,What to Do
12:17,"So, what are some of the best things to"
12:19,"do around here? Number one, let's get"
12:21,this one out of the way first. Busch
12:23,Gardens Tampa Bay. I'm sure you've heard
12:25,"about this place. Part theme park, part"
12:28,"zoo, this place has worldclass roller"
12:30,"coasters like Iron Guazi, which is"
12:31,currently one of the tallest and fastest
12:33,hybrid roller coasters in the whole
12:36,world. That thing is super intense.
12:38,"Plus, they've got lions, giraffes,"
12:40,"hyenas, and actual Serengeti style"
12:43,safaris. This is one of the biggest
12:45,"theme parks in the entire world, but"
12:47,check the weather before you plan a day
12:49,"here. This park, in your experience, can"
12:51,really be negatively impacted by a full
12:53,day of bad weather since almost all of
12:55,"the attractions are outdoors. Yeah,"
12:56,you're probably going to get that
12:58,passing thunderstorm that happens in
12:59,"Florida, that's not what I'm talking"
13:00,about. But if you look at the weather
13:03,"and see a lot of rain all day, you might"
13:04,want to schedule a different day to be
13:07,"here. But if you're a thrillseker, this"
13:09,is arguably the best theme park in
13:11,Florida. Worldclass roller coaster
13:13,collection here.
13:15,The Florida Aquarium is located just on
13:17,the edge of downtown near Sparkman
13:19,Wararf. This is actually one of the top
13:20,rated aquariums in the whole country. I
13:22,love this place. Used to be a season
13:25,pass member here for years. They've got
13:27,"sharks, stingrays, sea turtles. It's"
13:29,indoors. It's airond conditioned. That's
13:32,important. And educational. You can go
13:33,dolphin watching. You can explore a
13:36,"World War II era ship, the USS American"
13:38,Victory. Both of those do have an extra
13:40,"cost, by the way. And if you're here for"
13:41,a cruise and looking to kill a few hours
13:43,"before you set sail, this is a great"
13:45,choice since it's literally right next
13:49,to the cruise port. The Tampa Riverwalk.
13:50,"So, this is about 2 and a half miles"
13:52,along the Hillsboro River. And this
13:55,"riverwalk links up museums, parks,"
13:57,"restaurants, bars, lots of local"
13:59,"attractions. You can rent a scooter, you"
14:01,"can rent a bike, you can go for a jog,"
14:03,or just take a stroll. It's a great
14:05,"place to people watch, hang out, watch"
14:07,the boats cruise by. You might even spot
14:08,a dolphin or a manatee in the river.
14:10,right here. And this has been ranked as
14:12,one of the best riverw walks in the
14:14,country. And I did a video where I
14:16,explore the entire riverwalk. And I'll
14:17,link to that in the description. You get
14:19,to see all the sites. Along the way
14:21,"here, you'll pass by Curtis Hixon Park."
14:23,It's a big green space. It's perfect for
14:25,"families, music festivals, or just"
14:26,laying in the grass and staring at
14:28,downtown. Right next to that is the
14:30,"Glazer Children's Museum, a top pick if"
14:32,you've got kids with you. And the Tampa
14:34,"Museum of Art is right here, which has a"
14:36,pretty nice collection of modern and
14:38,classical art and some wild
14:40,architecture. This building looks really
14:42,"cool at night. Eventually, this is going"
14:44,to take you to Amaly Arena. This is the
14:45,"home of the Tampa Bay Lightning, and"
14:47,"it's a major concert venue, so there's"
14:49,always something happening right here.
14:51,And I really recommend catching a Tampa
14:52,Bay Lightning game if you're in town
14:54,during hockey season. This is a great
14:56,"venue, and the Lightning games are a"
14:58,great experience. And it doesn't hurt.
14:59,They always seem to have a good team out
15:02,"there, too. Eore City. Now, this is a"
15:03,neighborhood that was founded in the
15:06,1880s by Cuban cigar makers. And this is
15:08,Tampa's most historic and iconic
15:10,neighborhood.
15:12,"By day, it's charming and cultural."
15:14,"Brick buildings, brick streets. The"
15:15,trolley is going to roll right through
15:17,"here. And by night, it's Tampa's party"
15:19,"zone full of bars, clubs, live music"
15:21,"venues, places to sit outside and watch"
15:23,the neverending parade of interesting
15:26,"characters walk by. And fun fact,"
15:27,there's going to be lots of wild
15:29,chickens that roam the streets here. And
15:31,"they're even protected. And serious,"
15:33,"they have their own city ordinance, so"
15:37,"don't mess with the roosters, okay?"
15:38,"Oh, and this is the neighborhood where"
15:39,"you're gonna find the Colombia, that"
15:41,authentic Spanish restaurant I mentioned
15:43,earlier. There are a couple of other
15:44,"locations scattered around town, and I"
15:47,"think there is still one in Orlando, but"
15:50,this one is the OG. Zoo Tampa at Lowry
15:52,Park. This was voted as one of the best
15:56,midsize family zoos in the US. I really
15:57,like this zoo. There's a lot of shade
16:00,here. It's relatively compact and super
16:02,"interactive. You can feed a giraffe, you"
16:04,"can feed rhinos, you can see elephants,"
16:06,"apes, and there's a great manity rescue"
16:09,"and rehab center here, too. It's great"
16:11,"for kids, and it's great for adults who"
16:12,"want to see some animals, but they might"
16:14,want a less heartp pounding encounter
16:15,than the roller coasters over at Busch
16:17,Gardens.
16:19,"Armature Works. So, this place was once"
16:21,"a trolley barn, and now it's a trendy"
16:24,food hall with waterfront skyline views.
16:25,I like to call this place the local
16:27,"hipster food court, but I like this"
16:29,place because it's got something for
16:32,"everyone. Tacos, ramen, burgers, Korean"
16:35,"sushi, beer, craft cocktails, gelato. If"
16:36,you're with a big group and you don't
16:38,"know where to eat, come here. Someone's"
16:39,going to find something they like.
16:41,There's outdoor seating that turns this
16:42,place into a really cool scene at
16:45,sunset. There's a rooftop bar here.
16:47,Sometimes there's live music and DJs
16:49,playing tunes out here. Parking is 20
16:51,"bucks, though, which Yeah. Ouch. That's"
16:53,pretty pricey for something like this. I
16:55,actually really hate that on principal.
16:57,You're paying for parking only to come
16:59,inside and pay to eat. Don't love that.
17:01,But if you're willing to be patient and
17:03,"don't mind walking a couple blocks,"
17:04,sometimes you can find some street
17:06,parking in the nearby neighborhood.
17:07,Check signs though. You don't want to
17:08,park in a neighborhood you're not
17:11,supposed to be.
17:14,Sparkman Wararf. This is another
17:16,recently revitalized waterfront spot
17:17,with restaurants that are built right
17:19,into shipping containers. There's
17:21,"outdoor seating, a beer garden, live"
17:23,"music, and lawn games. You can come out"
17:25,here and play cornhole. It's great for
17:27,casual bites with a view of the cruise
17:28,ships and tuggos going by. I love to sit
17:31,out here and just watch the boats go by.
17:33,"The Tampa Bay History Center. Now, this"
17:35,is located on the Riverwalk and this is
17:37,a museum that tells the story of Tampa
17:39,from the indigenous people to pirates to
17:42,Cuban cigar rollers. And this museum is
17:44,really underrated and underappreciated.
17:47,I think it's a local gem. It really is a
17:48,"fantastic museum and I highly, highly"
17:50,recommend it. But I'm always surprised
17:52,how many of my friends and other locals
17:54,around here have never been there. It's
17:55,a huge building downtown. You can't miss
17:57,"it. Go check it out, people. This place"
18:00,is great. I love this museum.
18:02,"The Seol Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. So,"
18:04,"if you're feeling lucky, Tampa has its"
18:07,own little slice of Vegas right off I4.
18:09,The Seol Hard Rock is actually one of
18:10,the biggest casinos in the entire
18:12,country. There's thousands of slot
18:13,"machines, table games, and one of the"
18:16,largest poker rooms in Florida. It's
18:18,"loud, it's flashy, it's packed with rock"
18:20,"and roll memorabilia, including guitars,"
18:23,"costumes, and outfits worn by actual"
18:25,rock legends. And even if you don't
18:27,"gamble, there's a lot to see and do in"
18:28,"here. Multiple restaurants, a high-end"
18:32,"steakhouse, a rooftop bar, a 24-hour"
Beaches,"diner, and live music most nights."
There's some easy day trips to Clear,18:35
Water and St. Pete where you're going to,18:37
find the beaches. And so that brings up,18:38
a very common misconception that a lot,18:41
of people have about Tampa and that I,18:43
hear that Tampa is a great beach town.,18:45
"And no, you know, not really. There",18:47
aren't really any beaches in Tampa. You,18:49
can look at it on the map and see that,18:52
"it's right on the waters of Tampa Bay,",18:53
but there really aren't any decent,18:55
beaches in Tampa itself. You've got to,18:57
go about 30 to 45 minutes across the,18:59
bridges into Panellis County. But over,19:01
"there, you're going to find some of the",19:03
"best beaches in the country, and they",19:04
are worth the drive. Clearwater Beach,19:06
and all those beaches along the coast,19:09
over there have that beautiful perfect,19:10
white sand. Clearwater is really big,19:12
with tourists. I like St. Pete Beach and,19:15
I would also really recommend checking,19:18
out Fort Toddto. That's one of my,19:19
favorites in the area. You can take a,19:20
little day trip over to St. Pete which,19:23
"has a really cool downtown, a chill",19:24
"artsy vibe, a lot of murals, live music",19:27
"venues, and the Salvador Dolly Museum is",19:29
over there. St. Petersburg might,19:32
actually be one of the coolest towns in,19:34
Florida. Well worth a day trip. If you,19:36
"don't mind driving just a little bit,",19:39
Sarasota is a little over an hour to the,19:40
"south and it's home to Siesta Beach,",19:42
which is frequently rated as one of the,19:44
"best, if not the best beach in the",19:46
United States. I love that place. I love,19:48
Siesta Key. Tarpon Springs is another,19:50
place that's about an hour or so away.,19:52
It's just a little bit north of Clear,19:54
"Water, and it's a town with a very rich",19:55
Greek history. Great food here and a fun,19:57
little waterfront area called the Sponge,20:00
"Docks with Greek restaurants, boat",20:02
"tours, and even an entire museum",20:04
dedicated to sponge fishing. That's,20:06
exciting stuff. And Wikiwatchi Spring,20:08
State Park is just about an hour or so,20:11
north. This is one of Florida's most,20:13
iconic old roadside attractions where,20:15
the world famous underwater mermaid show,20:17
has been a daily event here since 1947.,20:19
You can also go swimming in the springs,20:22
"here. There's a little water park, boat",20:24
"tours, and you can even take a kayak",20:26
trip.,20:27
"So, here's a few final tips and final",20:30
thoughts and maybe a little bit about,20:32
the weather here. The Tampa weather has,20:33
two settings. Extremely hot and so humid,20:35
that it feels like you're living in,20:38
somebody's mouth and still hot but,20:40
slightly less humid. Summer basically,20:43
lasts all year with a brief winter,20:46
period that lasts about 2 weeks or so in,20:48
"January, give or take. When it dips into",20:50
"the 60s, everybody around here starts",20:52
complaining about the cold. It's,20:54
actually pretty funny. And the most,20:55
brutally hot time of the year is going,20:57
to be from June through September. For,20:59
"best weather experience, visit in spring",21:02
or fall. It's usually pretty dry. Then,21:04
you don't have to worry about the rain,21:05
"too much, and the weather is a lot more",21:07
tolerable for being outdoors. March,21:09
"through May or October through November,",21:11
"I think, are kind of the sweet spot.",21:13
Summers can be pretty brutal. But if you,21:15
"love a good afternoon thunderstorm,",21:17
you'll be right at home. Tampa is,21:18
considered the lightning capital of the,21:20
"United States, and we get some really",21:22
wild thunderstorms in the summer.,21:24
Sunscreen is not optional. If you're,21:26
"spending any time outdoors, you got to",21:28
"use it. Trust me, you got to do it.",21:30
Especially at the beach. Many a Florida,21:33
vacation has been ruined by forgetting,21:35
to or even refusing to use sunscreen. It,21:37
does not take long to go from pasty,21:40
"white to bright red out here. Yep,",21:42
"Canadians and Brits, I'm looking at you.",21:44
If you're going to be getting out into,21:47
"nature and exploring some state parks,",21:48
"some city parks, or some wetlands,",21:50
definitely don't forget the bug spray.,21:51
"And this last one, the locals might",21:54
"disagree with me strongly, but honestly,",21:56
I don't think the traffic in Tampa is,21:59
"all that terrible, especially compared",22:01
to some other cities. It could be,22:03
"better, but it could be a lot worse. I",22:05
really wish we would do something about,22:07
the mass transit around here. But I75,22:08
and the bridges that cross over Tampa,22:11
Bay really can be a mess at rush hour.,22:13
"In an absolute worst case scenario, when",22:16
"there's like a wreck or something, it",22:18
can and has taken me over an hour to,22:19
cross some of those bridges. But,22:22
everybody seems to think the traffic and,22:23
"the drivers in their town, the town they",22:25
"live in, is the worst. You ever notice",22:27
"that? Like, oh, look at how this guy is",22:29
"driving. Only in Milwaukee, am I right?",22:31
It's kind of funny. I think people here,22:34
"do it, too. They think the traffic and",22:35
the parking and the drivers here are the,22:37
worst in the world. I don't know. I,22:39
think it's about the same as anywhere,22:40
else.,22:41
All right. Phew. I think that just about,22:44
does it. That's my big overview of,22:45
Tampa. Thank you so much for watching.,22:47
"If you're planning a visit here, maybe",22:50
you're just curious about this town. Or,22:51
maybe you're a local who's about to,22:53
leave me a nasty comment because I just,22:54
"said, ""I didn't think traffic here was",22:56
"the absolute worst in the world."" I hope",22:58
you learned something. And if I forgot,23:00
"one of your favorites, please let me",23:01
know and everyone else know in the,23:03
comments. There's only so much time and,23:05
I can't hit them all. And it would mean,23:06
a lot to me if you hit that like button,23:09
and subscribe for more Florida,23:11
"adventures, offbeat attractions, theme",23:12
"parks, state parks, and whatever else we",23:15
can find around here. Stay safe and I'll,23:17
see you around the Sunshine State.,23:19
